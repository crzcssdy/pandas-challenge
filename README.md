# pandas-challenge

This assignment was aided with the assistance of a tutor who oversaw the intial work of this assignment and helped me figure out the proper functions without telling me exactly how the procedure should look. For additional assistance in debugging a couple of issues in the latter part of the assignment, I used ChatGPT - particularly when the code would not run and would issue the message "The default of observed=False is deprecated and will be changed to True in a future version of pandas."
